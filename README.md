## Installation

Please use the Flatpak package provided in the releases page, thanks!

## Known Issues

- No preferences dialog
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Shimeji might become a black square if they are moved to the center of the screen

## Future Plans

Once the manager part is ready I want to rewrite the whole Shimeji engine thing with Python (or maybe something else) instead of Java, whilst [Shimeji for Linux](https://github.com/asdfman/linux-shimeji) does the work just fine, I want to make it more mantainable to fix some errors and add new features.

## Where can I find Shimejis?

You should probably checkout [DevianArt](https://www.deviantart.com/tag/shimeji) they have a lot of Shimejis from different games, anime and stuff like that. Or just Google it idk.

## My Shimeji doesn't work :(
Open an issue and link me the Shimeji, there are a lot of different ways of making Shimejis, I'm still adapting my code so that it works with every single one.

## Flathub release

It's an early alpha, I will submit the app once I'm happy with it.

## Wayland

It does work with Wayland using XWayland, should be fine.
